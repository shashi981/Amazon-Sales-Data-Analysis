## 🛠️ Methodology

The analysis follows these steps:

### 1. Data Cleaning
   - Load and explore the data for an initial overview.  
   - Address missing values, remove duplicate records, and adjust data types.  
   - Standardize column headers for consistency.  
   - Detect anomalies and prepare data for in-depth analysis.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Study the patterns of key variables such as revenue, order priorities, and regions.  
   - Visualize variable distributions and examine correlations between fields.  

### 3. Deeper Analysis
   - **Top Performing Products**: Determine the most profitable products by analyzing revenue.  
   - **Trends Over Time**: Analyze monthly sales data to capture trends or seasonal patterns.  
   - **Order Priority Insights**: Use machine learning methods to analyze relationships that impact order priorities.  

### 4. Data Visualization
   - Use graphs to communicate insights clearly, focusing on revenue patterns, geographical distributions, and other key findings.  

### 5. Additional Investigations
   - Experiment with feature engineering and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE.  
   - Employ anomaly detection methods to identify outliers.  
   - Perform hypothesis testing to validate assumptions about patterns and relationships.
